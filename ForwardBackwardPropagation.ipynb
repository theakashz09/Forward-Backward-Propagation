        "## Q1. What is the purpose of forward propagation in a neural network?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans =Forward propagation is a fundamental step in the operation of a neural network. Its primary purpose is to compute and propagate the output of the network, starting from the input layer and proceeding through the hidden layers to the final output layer. During forward propagation, the network processes an input example and produces a prediction or output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key purposes of Forward Propagation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prediction:** The primary purpose of forward propagation is to make predictions or estimates based on the given input data. The input data, which could be an image, text, numerical values, etc., is fed into the network, and the network computes an output that represents the model's prediction or classification for that input. For example, in image classification, forward propagation takes an image as input and outputs the predicted class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Extraction:** In the process of forward propagation, the input data undergoes transformations in each layer of the network. These transformations can be thought of as feature extraction. Hidden layers of the network learn increasingly abstract and hierarchical features from the input data. These extracted features are crucial for the network to make accurate predictions or classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calculating Loss:** Forward propagation computes the network's output, which can then be compared to the actual target or ground truth. By measuring the difference between the predicted output and the true target, the network calculates a loss or error value. The loss serves as a measure of how well the network's predictions match the actual data. This loss is essential for training the network during the subsequent backpropagation step.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Activation:** In each layer of the neural network, forward propagation applies activation functions to the weighted sum of inputs. These activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, and softmax.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Weighted Sum Calculation:** Forward propagation computes a weighted sum of the inputs for each neuron in the network. This sum takes into account the strengths (weights) of connections between neurons in different layers. Each neuron's weighted sum is then passed through an activation function to produce the neuron's output.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Output Layer:** The final layer of the neural network, known as the output layer, typically uses an appropriate activation function for the specific task at hand. For instance, the softmax function is commonly used for multi-class classification problems, while a linear or sigmoid activation might be used for regression tasks or binary classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Passing Information to the Next Layer:** Forward propagation proceeds layer by layer, with each layer's output serving as the input to the next layer. This sequential flow of information allows the network to gradually transform and abstract features from the input data, ultimately leading to the network's prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The forward propagation is the process by which a neural network computes predictions, extracts features, and calculates the loss for a given input example. It is a crucial step in both inference (making predictions) and training (updating weights through backpropagation) in neural networks."

        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient Calculation:** Backward propagation calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights and biases.

        "4. **Training:** The ultimate goal of backward propagation is to train the neural network to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

It seeks to find the optimal set of weights and biases that minimize the loss function and make the network's predictions as accurate as possible.\n",

Regularization methods like L1 and L2 regularization can be applied to the gradients to encourage simpler and more generalizable models."
